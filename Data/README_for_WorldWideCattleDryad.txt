These are the data used in "Worldwide Patterns of Ancestry, Divergence, 
and Admixture in Domesticated Cattle" by Decker et al., arXiv:1309.5118

ww_cattle_dryad_20Sept2013.ped	
contains the genotype data in PLINK PED format. 
Illumina A alleles are coded as 1, and Illumina B alleles are
coded as 2. SNPs were filtered based on a call rate of 0.9 (--geno 0.1 
command in PLINK) and a MAF of 0.0005 to remove monomorphic SNPs 
(--maf 0.0005). SNPs on unassigned contigs and chromosome X were removed,
except for one pseudoautosomal SNP.

ww_cattle_dryad_20Sept2013.map	
contains SNP information in PLINK PED format.
Chromosome coordinates are according UMD3.1 assembly.

ww_cattle_dryad_20Sept2013.pedind	
contains population information for 1,543 animals. Breed code descriptions
can be found in Table S1 of the manuscript.
