This readme file describes the SNP data files files accompanying the above publication.  For any further queries please contact harley.smith@csiro.au

The following files are included:

1)  "all.taxamerged.filtered,recode.vcf" 
This is the vcf file provided by the Cornell University Institute of biotechnology Genotyping by Sequencing service. This file contains SNP data for C2-50, Riesling and the 90 C2-50 x Riesling F1 individuals.

2)  "C2_50_3974_SNPset.vcf"
This is the vcf file for the C2-50 SNP set containing 3974 SNPs. This SNP set was derived by retrieving SNPs that were heterozygous in C2-50 and homozygous in Riesling with an allele frequency between 40-60%.

3)  "Riesling_2973_SNPset.vcf"
This is the vcf file for the Riesling SNP set containing 2973 SNPs. This SNP set was derived by retrieving SNPs that were heterozygous in Riesling and homozygous in C2-50 with an allele frequency between 40-60%.

4) "C2_50_367_MJR1.out.txt"
This is the R/OneMap C2-50 curated SNP set used to map MJR1.

5)  "Riesling_404_MJR1.out.txt"
This is the R/OneMap Riesling curated SNP set which was used to determine if MJR1 maps to a linkage group in Riesling. Note: MJR1 did not map to any of the 19 linkage groups in Riesling.

6)  "C2_50_380_MJR1.out.txt"
This is R/OneMap C2-50 curated SNP set that contains the 15 Sequenom MassARRAY validated SNPs on LG18 plus the MJR1 marker.
